# *The Cherry On Top*

## What is this?
*The Cherry On Top* is a blocklist collection that I am hosting for myself, and others, which are additional sites that I have *personally* decided to use on my own netowrk. These sites are chosen based on my opinion, use case, and threat model. This will most likey *not* apply to **everyone**. However, *some* may find it useful. I decided to do this so others can have it, if they want it, and so I can have an organized adlist instead of manually adding domains directly and clogging up the Pihole UI.
