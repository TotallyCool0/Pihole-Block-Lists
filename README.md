# I give up. After 15 minutes or so.
I realized that this was not a practical idea. Millions of sites blacklisted with one url. Maybe one day, I'll host my own
site or something crazy. But not today. I left the original readme down below. If you happen to see this, you can learn a lesson.
Some big ideas that seem out of reach, are. It isn't the end of the world. Life moves on. Sometimes, despite what the world would teach you
today, you need to give up. Don't exhaust yourself on something that will never end. It can suck the life out of you. I am NOT, however, encouring
you to give up on life. That is the *last* thing I want from anybody. If you do feel like going that route, please, please, please. Get some help.
Talk to family, friends, a doctor. Call 911 or a helpline. Anything beats that route. I wanted to leave that little disclaimer. Projects can be abondoned and
even restarted. Life is fleeting and precious.

# *The Last Blocklist*

## What is this?
*The Last Blocklist* is the only blocklist you will ever need! Or at least, the only one I need.
Ok. I still use some. Joking aside, *The Last Blocklist* is a blocklist that combines all of the blocklists I was using for pihole.
You can add it to your Windows hosts file, pihole adlist, or anything that uses hosts format, to add a stupid amount of domains. It blocks a lot of junk. Ads, analytics and telemetry,
malware and phising, and adult sites. If this does not seem like the site for you, then move along.
