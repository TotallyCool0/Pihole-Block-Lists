# *The Last Blocklist*

## What is this?
*The Last Blocklist* is the only blocklist you will ever need! Or at least, the only one I need.
Ok. I still use some. Joking aside, *The Last Blocklist* is a blocklist that combines all of the blocklists I was using for pihole.
You can add it to your Windows hosts file, pihole adlist, or anything that uses hosts format, to add a stupid amount of domains. It blocks a lot of junk. Ads, analytics and telemetry,
malware and phising, and adult sites. If this does not seem like the site for you, then move along.
